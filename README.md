Here’s a professional README.md for your Spam Mail Detection project:

Spam Mail Detection 🔍✉️

A simple Spam Mail Detection web app using Flask (backend) and HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend). The model is trained using TF-IDF and Naïve Bayes.

🚀 Features
	•	📩 Detects whether an email is Spam or Not Spam
	•	🤖 Machine Learning Model: Uses Multinomial Naïve Bayes with TF-IDF vectorization
	•	🌐 Simple Frontend: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
	•	⚡ Fast & Lightweight API: Powered by Flask
